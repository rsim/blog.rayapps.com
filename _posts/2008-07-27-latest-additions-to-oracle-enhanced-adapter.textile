Short information about latest enhancements in ActiveRecord Oracle enhanced adapter:

* Oracle enhanced adapter is now compatible with <a href="http://compositekeys.rubyforge.org/">composite_primary_keys gem</a> which is quite useful if you are working with legacy databases.
* Adapter now is also working correctly with Rails 2.1 partial_updates enabled. Previously I mentioned that you needed to disable partial_updates when using CLOB/BLOB columns. Now the issue is found and fixed and partial_updates are working with CLOB/BLOB columns.
* Support for other date and time formats when assigning string to :date or :datetime column. For example, if you would like to assign strings with format dd.mm.yyyy to date and datetime columns then add the following configuration options:
{% highlight ruby %}
ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::OracleEnhancedAdapter.string_to_date_format = "%d.%m.%Y"
ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::OracleEnhancedAdapter.string_to_time_format = "%d.%m.%Y %H:%M:%S"
{% endhighlight %}

To get the new release of Oracle enhanced adapter do as always:

pre(terminal). sudo gem install activerecord-oracle_enhanced-adapter
